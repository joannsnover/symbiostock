    <h2>Welcome to Symbiostock</h2>
    <p><strong>Thank you for using Symbiostock</strong>. Here is some quick inspiration to get you headed toward success in selling images direct.</p>
    <p>Symbiostock is open source. As its name implies, it was developed to succeed in an environment of working together, in &quot;Symbiosis&quot;. Symbiostock is as much of a community science project as it is a practical measure to make your living selling images.</p>
    <strong>Symbiosis</strong>
    <div>
        <div class="ds-list"><b>1.</b> (Life Sciences &amp; Allied Applications / Biology) a close and usually obligatory association of two organisms of different species that live together, often to their mutual benefit</div>
        <div class="ds-list"><b>2.</b> (Sociology) a similar relationship between interdependent persons or groups
            <div class="etyseg">[via New Latin from Greek: a living together; see <span style="font-variant:small-caps">symbiont</span>]</div>

    <p>The growth of the Symbiostock network will take us through all sorts of adventures - imaging, code writing, analytics, and expanding the network. While each Symbiostock site has the ability to be independent, it will thrive most when it is joined with the network it was made for.</p>
    <p>While Symbiostock was developed primarily with the individual in mind, it can also benefit agencies as well. As tradition with most open source software goes - you have plenty of flexibility to make it work the way you want it to.</p>
    <h2>How to Succeed Selling Images Direct</h2>
    <p>Maintaining a website and making it succeed is a fairly ongoing job. It can be as much or as little as you want it to be. But there are some things you should take into consideration in promoting your images:</p>
    <h2>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h2>
    <p>Most likely you are accustomed to a routine of embedding information into your images, then upon upload, the agency extracts this data and produces an image page. 6 or 7 agencies might have your same image with the same content! Your image competes with itself this way, and does not help your search rankings if your website share's the same content as these other agencies. </p>
    <p>While the automated upload routine is perfectly is perfectly possible with the Symbiostock system, it will not profit you very quickly. Meaningful information is everything in the world of SEO. This tends to be a little bit of extra time/work which is well spent. When you upload images to your site, save them as drafts. Then follow them up by changing certain values. In order of priority: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Change the image title. Think of keywords or key phrases you know buyers will be searching. Put these toward the beginning of the title, as this is where they have the greatest weight. </li>
        <li>Change the &quot;slug&quot; / URL that will appear in the address bar. In wordpress, this appears below the title. Change before you publish. Generally if it matches the title, that will be helpful. You can also attempt to add contextual meaning by using related keywords, though its not certain how much this helps.</li>
        <li>Write a meaningful description, using your keywords. Use natural language, not keyword stuffing, but something that appeals to the search engine and to the reader. In fact, you may find it helpful to add more information regarding the image (and accompanying files). Make an attempt to bolden certain phrases you wish to stand out to both people and search results.</li>
        <li>Your keywording (taxonomy/tag) system is important, but probably not hugely important to SEO as this was one of the first things exploited in the early days of search engines. Still, adding relevant keywords and taking away the useless ones will increase the value of the page content. </li>
        <li>Categories are also a taxonomy system like keywords. But groups of related images may be gauged by search engines as a way to estimate the subject they should fall under. For instance, if &quot;Lock&quot; is found in your title, a search engine would not know what sort of lock we are referring to unless the context is obvious. Lock of hair? Section of a water-way? Door lock? Wrestling move? If you want to score high in search, be sure context is obvious through any reasonable measure you can take. Taxonomy systems most likely have some relevance in putting your content in front of the right paying crowd. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Content and links toward the top of your page have most value. Content at the bottom (toward the footer) has less value. </p>
    <p>Symbiostock will continue to be developed using markup that is relevant to machines, such as microformats/microdata, and will always attempt to be on the leading edge of SEO as it gets perfected. This will give you a huge advantage in getting found in places beyond just Google, but you can only increase this advantage by putting the work mentioned above into your content. </p>
    <p>On that note, please ignore most paid  search presence unless it is directly related to microstock and has proven results. Facebook and Google paid searches (in my opinion) will unlikely pay for themselves in this field.</p>
    <h2>Your Network Presence</h2>
    <p>Being a part of the Symbiostock network benefits more than just human browsing! Its valuable backlinking system. It quickens your search engine presence with new content. What happens on your friend's site will affect yours, and the other way around. As networks mature and their sites increase in age and content value, you will find your team efforts effect everyone and yourself to a large degree. Daily sales should be the expected norm after a year or so.</p>
    <p>Symbiostock will not be developed around human stupidity! If any exploitative or greedy activity happens in networks (things too many to mention) this will have to be policed by your own human discretion. Policing and exploit suppression will not be built into the code. Your network is based on trust. Adding experienced professionals to your network who you intend to cooperate with is the smart way to go. Indiscriminately adding people just to promote - will either not benefit you or rob benefits. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Avoid adding content which will flag you (and your network associates!) in a content area which is blocked or filtered! </p>
    <h2>Symbiostock Goals</h2>
    <p>Symbiostock's main goal is to be a strong network. Thoughtfully created content, a strong SEO regimen, and a prolific networking system will hopefully make Symbiostock a well recognized and trusted network. </p>
    <p>Above all it aims to benefit individuals who work hard to provide for themselves and their families. </p>
    <p>While the system is made to promote royalty free content, its main objective is to bring customers to artists and build professional relationships.</p>

            <h1>Tinny's Getting Started Tutorial</h1>
            <p>Tutorial for Symbiostock Arcitum to be read in conjunction with the help pages.</p>
            <p>Hopefully this will help you with getting started with the Symbiostock Arcitum, Stock Image networking theme created by Leo Blanchette.  This tutorial was created for early  V2</p>
            <h3>INSTALLATION</h3>
            <p>I will assume you already have Wordpress installed on your site with only the default settings.</p>
            <p>Install and Activate Symbiostock Arcitum,</p>
            <p>Although it is not essential I would also recommend you repeat this procedure with the Symbiostock Child theme, then if you ever decide to edit any of the css you will not have to re-edit if you update the parent theme.</p>
            <p>Now take time to look around and familiarise yourself with the various areas especially:</p>
            <p>Appearance – menus and widgets.<br>
                Users – your profile area<br>
                Settings – general and Permalinks<br>
                Symbiostock (bee) – the heart of the networking area, especially take note of the Symbiostock Help tab!<br>
                Images (ladybird) – image control</p>

                Exclusive:   Your images are only available on your Symbiostock site<br>
                Not Exclusive:  Your images are available for licence/sale elsewhere such as stock sites.<br>
                Live/Not live:   Live for when you are ready to sell/licence your images to customers<br>
                Not Live:  If you are not yet ready to sell, or do not have enough images up or your site ready yet.  Very useful also if you just wish to display the images you have on stock sites.  You can link to them further down the page in the Referral Links area<br>

                stock images by xx, perfect stock images, images by xxx, royalty free images (latter not really recommended as you will get lots of people coming to you looking for free images and many of the EULA (end user licence agreements) that members use do not use the wording of royalty free.</p>
            <p>Referral Links<br>
                If your images are exclusive elsewhere or if you just wish to display for some reason and sell though stock sites then add the link to your portfolio(s) here</p>

            <h3>MARKETING</h3>
            <p><strong>[in development]</strong> Self explanatory – and displays results when you click the buttons</p>
            <h3>SYMBIOSTOCK HELP</h3>
            <p>One of the most important pages here – read it!</p>
            <h3>APPEARANCE</h3>
            <p>One major benefit of Wordpress and thus Symbiostock is the ability to edit the theme to your own preferences.</p>
            <p>When you first open it, it looks somewhat boring and there is lots of data in the top right hand corner (above header area), most of us have edited this to just show login and contact details.  To get<br>
                CONTACT DETAILS you are best using a plug in such as Contact Form 7 (go to Plug Ins and search) then install and activate it.  Edit it to your liking and remove the extra &lt; &gt; that it automatically places around [email] or you will not get the email address of the person contacting you.</p>
            <p>In your Pages section Symbiostock automatically creates some pages, I think this is one of them, you can add additional text if you wish.</p>
            <p>Now to make use of that contact form</p>
            <p>Go to Appearance, Menus</p>
            <p>Click on the little plus sign and in the menu name box add &quot; above header &quot; – without the quote marks and save menu.<br>
                On the left hand side of the page select Above Header in the theme locations above header box and save.  Keep saving so you do not forget and lose your work.</p>
            <p>Repeat this with header as you will also need a header soon.</p>
            <p>Now select your &quot;above header&quot; tab .  On the left hand side of the page there will be a section called &quot;Pages&quot;, if it is not showing then go to the top right of the page just under where it says Howdy, select &quot;screen options&quot; and the drop down will give you a list of options you can show on the page.  Once you have pages showing then click in the box next to &quot;Contact&quot; and click the add to menu box below it.  This will now show up in your header so SAVE.</p>
            <h3>CATEGORY MENU in HEADER</h3>
            <p>The time will come when you wish to add categories to your header menu.  Use the same method but instead of adding from &quot;pages&quot; add them from &quot;image categories&quot;.  If you wish to have child categories such as Animal – dog then just pull the Dog tab slightly to the right so it indents under Animal.  You can change the order of these by dragging them up and down as you wish.</p>
            <p>You can also add pages to the Header menu.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>PLUG INS</h3>
            <p>There are hundreds if not thousands of plug-ins available for Wordpress, some work well and others fight against the theme you are using so once you are set up if things are not working as you expect try de-activating the plug-ins before you try anything else.</p>
            <p>WIDGETS</p>
            <p>Symbiostock has various widgets available for latest images, Symbiostock selected images (use the category to select these when you are processing them) and more as Leo develops the theme.</p>
            <p>I have found the best way of getting them working on the home page is to use the page template – HOME PAGE CTA's</p>
            <p>To set the widgets up go to Appearance – Widgets and drag the ones you wish to use across to the various page options</p>
            <p>Royalty Free IMAGES (with ladybird)</p>
            <p>All Images – this is where all your images are listed and where they are put so you can edit them with  their descriptions, categories, SEO data (Yoast works well with Symbiostock) etc.</p>
            <p>Image Categories  Here you can add, delete and edit the categories you wish to use for your images, many stock creators do not like using them but they are very useful with Symbiostock and for SEO</p>
            <p>Image Keywords.  Here you can add, edit and delete keywords such as those you have misspelt or added accidentally</p>
            <p>Upload Images  This is one of the methods you can use for uploading your image<br>
                Upload Images  This is one of the methods you can use for uploading your image</p>
            <p>Process Images.  This is where your images go when they are first uploaded, from here you Process them either to drafts so you can add keywords, SEO, categories etc or direct to Publish<br>
            </p>
            <h3>DATA SHEETS</h3>
            <p>These are a little bonus feature added to Symbiostock. See the help item "datasheets" to find out more. This feature is experimental and still being developed.

                <p>The most important panel in your networking settings. Once a site has been set up with its data (the more the better) a <strong>symbiocard.csv</strong> file can be created by the site owner, and sent to people they wish to network with. <br />
                    <br />
                    You in turn upload the .csv file and the system uses the values it contains to populate local info in linking to them. Obviously they do the same for you. <br />
                    <br />
                    If you manually type in the address into the bar, your website will fetch the .csv file itself and (if it exists) will autopopulate info that way.</p>

            <li>
                <h3 id="csv_file"><span class="description">Network  &mdash; </span>.csv and symbiocard Files Explained</h3>
                <p>Introducing the <strong>symbiocard!</strong> Its actually symbiocard.csv to be exact. The symbiocard can be likened to a "seed", such as a <a title="burdock" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctium">burdock seed</a> or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taraxacum">dandelion seed.</a><br />
                    <br />
                    The symbiocard actually "travels" the network based on user activity and promotes your site where relevant. Much like a burdock seed, it relies on human traffic to find its way around. Or much like a dendelion seed, it simply kites its way from one point to another. The little "symbiocard" an essential component in Symbiostock mutual promotion, since it viturally takes on a life course of its own in spreading your website's presence.</p>
                <p>Your site uses two very useful (and ancient!) web technologies to network. XML and .csv files. This allows your data to be machine-used in applications beyond mere web display. As Symbiostock grows, so will use of these simple data sharing languages.<br />
                    <br />
                    By clicking on the ",a," icon beside either your url or your network associate's, you can automatically fetch symbiocard.csv files for distribution. This is helpful, for instance, in setting up Symbiostock directories.<br />
                    <br />
                    You can update your symbiocard.csv file at any time by clicking the "Update public network info" checkbox at the bottom of your Symbiostock admin panels. It will then be generated as a "symbiocard.csv" file which will sit in your Wordpress install root, where in turn other Symbiostock sites will refer to update their information on you. This is also where the download link refers when you download your .csv file for sending to prospective network partners or hubs.</p>

Good for "Niche" sites that have specific specialties.

                <p><strong>Correspondence Email &mdash; </strong>The specific email address your site will use in sending automated messages to customer, and what they will respond to if they wish.</p>
                <p>You may notice that when Symbiostock installs, a little email plugin is installed as well. If you deactivate this plugin, your Symbiostock correspondence system will break. Wordpress requires a plugin to change email settings for some reason. You an pre-write customer <strong>welcome</strong> and <strong>thank you</strong> email messages on the Settings page.</p>
                <p>Be sure to add some detail to your "Welcome" email setting, talking about your site, specialties, and thanking them. <br />
                    For the "Thank you" email you may wish to add some text regarding future offers, subscribing, etc. And of course THANK THEM! :D</p>

                <p>At the time of this writing, backlinking is one of the few ways I profit on this theme, as well as the others which have given crucial support and inspiration to its development in the earliest days. Although you have the ability to turn these off, its actually a rather harmless/no-cost way you can "give a little back" to the theme creator and its main supporters, especially since the backlinks are not unattractive.</p>

                <p>This runs a script that gauges similarity of images by how many occurances of keywords they share. When this script runs, every image is compared to every other image in your portfolio. The more images you have, the longer it will take to run. It will email you with progress occassionally.<br />
                    <br />
                    Some servers may shut down this script from running too long. This issue is being addressed.</p>

                <p>Size settings that will be applied to images on upload. These cannot (yet) be changed after uploading, so be sure to choose something that fits your portfolio's average image size, or change these settings before uploading an image batch.</p>

                <p>"Datasheets" are pages that are created or updated automatically when you create or update an image page. <strong>This feature is optional, and pertains mostly to photographers</strong>, although illustrators may use it too.</p>
                <p>Symbiostock attempts to put as much attribution and credibility to the image creator as possible. This is especially important during this time when image laws and IPTC standards are evolving. When an image page is saved, it will check if "Enable Datasheets" is set. If active, it will collect all IPTC data from the image and create a whole page on it. The page will reference your image, and the image page will reference the datasheet.</p>
                <p>The datasheet will show much relevant info, from data you personally entered, to other aspects regarding the image's creation. This could be relevant in many situations, but mostly it adds another layer of credibility to your website's content and you, the photographer/illustrator.</p>

                <h3 id="image_processing"><span class="description">Image Processing  &mdash; </span>ImageMagic or GD Library</h3>
                <p>Some notes on your server's image processing methods &mdash; there are a few things that influence your server's ability to process large images, and large amounts of images.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The image processing module: <strong>ImageMagic</strong>, or inferior choice, <strong>GD Library</strong></li>
                    <li>Memory allowed: <a title="configuring wordpress's memory allowance" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#Increasing_memory_allocated_to_PHP">Edit wp-config.php file to change performance.</a></li>
                    <li>Maximum allowed time a script can run.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Image processing occurs in a few areas in the Symbiostock theme:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><a title="Processing uploads" href="<?php echo get_home_url(); ?>/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=image&page=symbiostock-process-images">Process Uploads</a> (Note at top of screen, it will tell you if you are using GD or ImageMagic)</li>
                    <li><a title="Image List" href="<?php echo get_home_url(); ?>/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=image">Images Listing / Editing Area</a> ("Bulk Options" dropdown, "<strong>Reprocess</strong>")</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Symbiostock checks to see if your server is using <strong>ImageMagick</strong> and if its not, it falls back to <strong>GD Library</strong>. Its highly advised you configure your server to use ImageMagic if it does not already. It uses less memory and generally produces better results. "Cheap" hosting using GD Library will give you much trouble with frequest script crashes, though will often still give satisfactory results in a good server environment.</p>
                <p>If you can't seem to break out of memory limitations, use <strong><a title="Use Bluehost Instead" href="http://www.bluehost.com/track/symbiostock">BLUEHOST</a></strong> as your hosting company instead. <a title="Use Bluehost Instead" href="http://www.bluehost.com/track/symbiostock">BLUEHOST</a> has the best cost/power ratio and Symbiostock sites do great on it.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3 id="shortcodes"><span class="description">Widgets  &mdash; </span>Sliders and Shortcodes</h3>
                <p>At this time there are five sliders natively used in Symbiostock - 4 of which you can control. They are available as widgets, but for further control you can also employ them by way of shortcodes.</p>
                <p>Lets assume your like most Symbiostock users and are fairly new to wordpress. We will do a quick explantion of "shortcodes" and how they work.</p>
                <p>Here is an example of a slider shortcode: <strong>[ss-slider id=123 size=preview action=latest]</strong>. There is nothing too it.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li> <strong>[ss-slider]</strong> &mdash; Tells Symbiostock you are calling a slider widget. </li>
                    <li> <strong>id=123</strong> &mdash; Tells Symbiostock to assign an ID to the slider. Make it random...123, i-love-sliders, whatever. It simply makes each slider unique to prevent clashes. </li>
                    <li> <strong>size=preview</strong> &mdash; Do you want to showcase images as preview or minipic?  Possible values: <strong>preview</strong> or <strong>minipic</strong> </li>
                    <li> <strong>action=latest</strong> &mdash; Possible values: <strong>latest</strong> or <strong>featured</strong>. </li>
                </ol>
                <p>So by way of example: Lets say I'm making a post or setting up a gallery page. I want to show a slider of my featured images, and I want them "minipic" size as opposed to "preview". I will simply paste this shortcode into the post: [ss-slider id=some-random-id size=minipic action=featured]</p>
                Fealing lazy? Want me to just give you some? <br />
                <br />
                <strong>[ss-slider id=my-preview-slider size=preview action=latest]</strong> &mdash; Type: Latest, Size: Preview <br />
                <br />
                <strong>[ss-slider id=my-preview-slider size=preview action=featured]</strong> &mdash; Type: Featured, Size: Preview <br />
                <br />
                <strong>[ss-slider id=my-preview-slider size=minipic action=latest]</strong> &mdash; Type: Latest, Size: Minipic <br />
                <br />
                <strong>[ss-slider id=my-preview-slider size=minipic action=featured]</strong> &mdash; Type: Featured, Size: Minipic </li>
